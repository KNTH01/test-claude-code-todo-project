## 🎯 Project Vision & Thinking Process

### Initial Analysis
When I received this prompt, I immediately recognized that this wasn't just about creating "a simple todo app" - the mention of creativity, latest technologies, and comprehensive documentation suggested this was meant to be a showcase project. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Technology Stack Analysis**: The request for Vite, Vue, Tailwind, and DaisyUI indicated a modern, performant, and visually appealing application
2. **Creative Interpretation**: "Be extra creative" meant going beyond basic CRUD operations to include innovative UX/UI elements
3. **Documentation Requirement**: The emphasis on documenting everything suggested this would be shared as a learning resource or portfolio piece

### Creative Vision
I envisioned a todo app that would stand out through:
- **Glass Morphism Design**: Modern, translucent UI elements with backdrop blur effects
- **Delightful Animations**: Smooth transitions, confetti celebrations, and micro-interactions
- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Beyond basic todos, including categories, priorities, statistics, achievements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Automatic theme detection with manual toggle
- **Data Persistence**: Local storage with robust error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Decisions

### Core Stack
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **Vue 3**: Modern reactive framework with Composition API
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **DaisyUI**: Component library built on Tailwind for consistent design patterns
- **Vue Router**: Client-side routing for multi-page navigation
- **Pinia**: Modern state management (though ultimately used composables instead for simplicity)

### Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Composables over Pinia
While Pinia was initially planned, I chose to use Vue 3's Composition API with composables for state management because:
- Simpler setup for a focused application
- Direct reactivity without additional abstraction
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Local storage integration is more straightforward

#### 2. Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── todo/          # Todo-specific components
│   │   ├── TodoForm.vue
│   │   ├── TodoItem.vue
│   │   ├── TodoEditForm.vue
│   │   └── TodoFilters.vue
│   └── ui/            # Reusable UI components (future)
├── composables/       # Reactive logic
│   └── useTodos.ts
├── types/            # TypeScript definitions
│   └── todo.ts
├── views/            # Page components
│   ├── TodoApp.vue
│   └── StatsView.vue
└── stores/           # Pinia stores (unused in final implementation)
```

#### 3. Type Safety Strategy
Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for:
- `Todo`: Core todo item structure
- `TodoCategory`: Category definitions with colors and icons
- `TodoFilter`: Filtering and search parameters
- `TodoStats`: Statistical calculations
- `TodoSort`: Sorting options

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Visual Design Principles
1. **Glass Morphism**: Translucent backgrounds with backdrop blur for modern aesthetics
2. **Gradient Backgrounds**: Dynamic color gradients that change between light/dark themes
3. **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects, transitions, and animations that provide feedback
4. **Accessibility**: Proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
5. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices

### Color Scheme Strategy
- **Light Theme**: Blue to indigo gradients with glass morphism effects
- **Dark Theme**: Gray to indigo gradients maintaining visual hierarchy
- **Semantic Colors**: Green for completed, red for overdue, yellow for medium priority
- **DaisyUI Themes**: Leveraging DaisyUI's extensive theme system for consistency

### Typography & Spacing
- **System Fonts**: Relying on system font stacks for performance and familiarity
- **Consistent Spacing**: Tailwind's spacing scale for uniform layouts
- **Emoji Integration**: Strategic use of emojis for personality and visual hierarchy

watch(categories, saveTodos, { deep: true })

// Error handling for localStorage limitations
const saveTodos = () => {
  try {
    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(todos.value))
    localStorage.setItem(CATEGORIES_KEY, JSON.stringify(categories.value))
  } catch (error) {
